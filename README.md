### How to Avoid TLE 
*  Number of Elementary Operations that can be done in 1 Sec is 10^8. If your algorithm is achieving it in <=10^8 (Including Constraints), then we can use bruteforce approach to solve the problem. 

Use the information in a question to your advantage! It will often implicitly tell you how efficient your algorithm should be to get full points. Consider the fact that a computer can run 108 iterations per second. Youâ€™re usually going to be given an array or string; call its size n. Note that you cannot be asked to come up with a solution better than O(n) in this case (even if one exists); the reason is that it takes linear time to input the test array itself! With that in mind,

- If (n >= 10^4), aim for a O(n) or a O(n log n) solution.
- If (n <= 10^3), aim for a O(n2) solution
- I(n <= 10^2), aim for a O(n3) solution
- If (n < 20), a O(2n) solution should be fine.

## Time Complexities of Common Operations for Java Collections

| Operation                        | ArrayList           | LinkedList          | HashSet   | HashMap   | TreeMap   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Access (get)                     | O(1)                | O(n)                | N/A       | N/A       | O(log n)  |
| Search (contains)                | O(n)                | O(n)                | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(log n)  |
| Insert (add at end)              | O(1)                | O(1)                | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(log n)  |
| Insert (add at specific index)   | O(n)                | O(n)                | N/A       | N/A       | O(log n)  |
| Delete (remove at end)           | O(1)                | O(1)                | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(log n)  |
| Delete (remove at specific index)| O(n)                | O(n)                | N/A       | N/A       | O(log n)  |
| Sort (using default comparator)  | O(n log n)          | O(n log n)          | N/A       | N/A       | O(n log n)|
| Sort (using custom comparator)   | O(n log n)          | O(n log n)          | N/A       | N/A       | O(n log n)|
| Count Occurrences                | O(n)                | O(n)                | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)      |
| Synchronized View                | O(1)                | O(1)                | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(1)      |
| Unmodifiable View                | O(1)                | O(1)                | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(1)      |

Note:
- ArrayList and LinkedList are different implementations of the List interface.
- HashSet, HashMap, and TreeMap are implementations of the Set and Map interfaces.
- N/A indicates that the operation is not applicable for that particular data structure.
- Synchronized View: Functions like Collections.synchronizedList(), Collections.synchronizedSet(), and Collections.synchronizedMap() return synchronized (thread-safe) views of the specified collections.

- Unmodifiable View: Functions like Collections.unmodifiableList(), Collections.unmodifiableSet(), and Collections.unmodifiableMap() return unmodifiable views of the specified collections, making them read-only.
