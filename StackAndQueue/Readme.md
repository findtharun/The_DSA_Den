<h2> Stacks </h2>

* Stacks are very useful in converting ionfix to Postfix/ Prefix.
    * Infix Expresssions are human readable but not efficient for machine reading. (This require Knowing Precedence and Associativity of Operators for Evaluating the Expressions at each level).
    * In Prefix and Postfix, based on Precedence and Associativity an expression is generated, can be evaluated in one pass efficiently.
    * Postfix is used by compilers to Perform Arithmetic Calculations.

NOTE : We can Access Elements in Stack using Get function. (Stack.get(0) gives first inserted element )

<h2> Queues </h2>

* Queue is an Interface; cannot be instantiated. 
    * Queue should always be Implemented using LL or Prioirty Queue.

<h2> Stack vs Heap </h2>

* Function Variables (Local) and Value Types are Generally Stored on Stack.
* References Variables Value, Data Structures and Global Variables are stored on Heap. However, Reference Pointer is Stored on Stack.
* Stacks are Thread Safe unlike Heaps.

<h4> Exceptions </h4>

* Static Variables are Stored in Heap.
* Anonymous Function Variables are Stored in Heap.
* Asynchronous Methods/Functions use Heap Memory.
