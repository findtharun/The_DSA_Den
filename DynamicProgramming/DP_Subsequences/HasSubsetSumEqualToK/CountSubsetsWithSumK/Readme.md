In this Problem , Array contains 0 - Hence base case changes a lot.

- If we just want to find whether subset has sum with K , then no changes.
- However, if we want the count of subsets with sum k then logic has to be updated.
    - Ex : [0,0,1] --  HasSubset Logic gives 2, However answer is 4 . (Count subsets with sum k has the exact solution)
