|      Approach       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
|     Brute Force     |     O(N\*N)     |       O(1)       |
|       HashMap       |   O(N\*logN)    |       O(N)       |
| Moore's Voting Algo |      O(N)       |       O(1)       |

We are using a map data structure. Insertion in the map takes logN time. And we are doing it for N elements. So, it results in the first term O(N\*logN).
