* In the Recursion Binary Split Approach, we can observe at the End Level we get our result sets. Hence We check ind == n and add.
Each recursion level focuses on one element, we need to decide choose or not choose this element. (Every level split into 2 branches.)

* In the RecursionNSpliit Approach , Each recursion level focuses on all the following elements. We scan through all the following elements and decide whether to choose or not choose that element. (Every level split into N branches.)
